# notclock: a terminal clock made with notcurses

I wanted to learn how to use notcurses, so I made a simple clock

## Features

- Background image support
- Change color of clock

## Installation

1. Download (notcurses)[https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses]

2. Clone this repo

3. `make` (install coming soon)

## Usage

`./clock [path/to/background/image]`

## TODO

1. Implement resize handler (??)
2. Background gifs (maybe)
3. Try to get rid of some magic number constants
